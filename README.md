Hi all:)

This task made by the university for finding differences between algorithms complexity and finding differences between elements on given list / array .

My progrem gives an indication of which algorithm is best to choose to find the number of different elements in the list / array.

The list of algorithms that can be used in the program:
1.Insertion Sort.
2.Counting Sort.
3.BTS.
4.Merge Sort
5.Hash Table

I've made this task in C Programming language.

***I did this task in 2021***


That's it for now. :)
